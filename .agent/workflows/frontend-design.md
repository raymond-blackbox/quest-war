# Frontend Design Workflow

This workflow guides the creation of distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics. Implement real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.

## Phase 1: Planning & Design Thinking (Mode: PLANNING)

Before coding, understand the context and commit to a **BOLD** aesthetic direction.

1.  **Analyze Requirements**: What problem does this solve? Who is the audience?
2.  **Define Aesthetic Tone**: Choose an extreme (brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic/natural, luxury/refined, playful/toy-like, editorial/magazine, brutalist/raw, etc.).
3.  **Identify Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility).
4.  **Aesthetic Exploration**:
    - // turbo
      **Research Trends**: Use `browser_subagent` to research modern design inspirations related to the chosen tone.
    - // turbo
      **Visual Brainstorming**: Use `generate_image` to create a mood board or UI concept mockup if the user hasn't provided one.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. Intentionality is key.

## Phase 2: Implementation (Mode: EXECUTION)

Implement working code (HTML/CSS/JS, React, Vue, etc.) that is visually striking and meticulously refined.

### Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines

-   **Typography**: Choose unique, characterful fonts. Pair a distinctive display font with a refined body font. Avoid Inter, Roboto, Arial unless explicitly required.
-   **Color & Theme**: Commit to a cohesive palette using CSS variables. Dominant colors with sharp accents work best.
-   **Motion & Interaction**: 
    - Prioritize CSS animations and micro-interactions.
    - Use Framer Motion for React projects.
    - Create "delight" moments (page load staggered reveals, hover states).
-   **Spatial Composition**: Use unexpected layouts, asymmetry, grid-breaking elements, and generous negative space.
-   **Visual Depth**: Add atmosphere with gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns, layered transparencies, dramatic shadows, and grain overlays.

> [!WARNING]
> **NEVER** use generic AI-generated aesthetics like cliched purple gradients on white backgrounds or system font stacks.

## Phase 3: Verification (Mode: VERIFICATION)

Ensure the implementation matches the vision and is functional.

1.  **UI/UX Audit**:
    - // turbo
      **Visual Review**: Use `browser_subagent` to take screenshots and verify the layout, typography, and color accuracy against the plan.
2.  **Code Quality**: Ensure the code is production-grade and accessible.
3.  **Documentation**: Create a `walkthrough.md` with embedded screenshots of the result.
